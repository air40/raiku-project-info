# Raiku Overview

## What problem does Raiku solve?
Blockchain networks face three major challenges before they can reach global adoption:

- Reliability & security comparable to traditional systems  
- Performance that supports both generalized and app-specific use-cases  
- Design flexibility that enables new business models and sustainable incentives  

## What is Raiku?
Raiku extends **Solana’s capabilities** by enabling block builders to offer differentiated feature sets such as:

- Exclusive blockspace access  
- Protection from transaction value extraction (MEV / sandwiching)  
- Pre-confirmations for faster execution  

With execution and consensus placed on distinct layers, Raiku’s decoupled block building system creates additional revenue channels for builders and validators, while enhancing the incentive design across the Solana ecosystem.

**Put simply:**  
Applications can secure priority, reduce latency, and achieve institutional-grade performance. Developers can build high-speed, specialized apps that integrate seamlessly with Solana.
