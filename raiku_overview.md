# Raiku Overview

## What problem does Raiku solve?
Blockchain networks face three major challenges before they can reach global adoption:

- Reliability & security comparable to traditional systems  
- Performance that supports both generalized and app-specific use-cases  
- Design flexibility that enables new business models and sustainable incentives  

## What is Raiku?
Raiku extends **Solanaâ€™s capabilities** by enabling block builders to offer differentiated feature sets such as:

- Exclusive blockspace access  
- Protection from transaction value extraction (MEV / sandwiching)  
- Pre-confirmations for faster execution  



**Put simply:**  
Applications can secure priority, reduce latency, and achieve institutional-grade performance. Developers can build high-speed, specialized apps that integrate seamlessly with Solana.
